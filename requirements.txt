# Backend Requirements File
# This file lists all the dependencies required for the Emotion Recognition Backend.
# It includes libraries for web framework, database interaction, audio processing,
# machine learning, authentication, and development tools.
# Each dependency is pinned to a specific version to ensure compatibility.

# To install the dependencies, run:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or create a virtual environment and then install.
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/Mac)
# venv\Scripts\activate     (Windows)
# pip install -r requirements.txt


# Alternative: You can perform installations individually as needed.
# E.g., pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy (then add others if required)
